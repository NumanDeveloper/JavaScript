# isPalindrome.js
* Logic is very simple
* `Point two pointers` to start and end of string respectively
* `Traverse` in forward and backward at once 
* Continuously `compare` corresponding letter in a loop
* If at any point, corresponding letters do not match, return `false`
* If loop terminates successfully, return `true`
